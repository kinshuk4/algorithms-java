 * 714. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock with Transaction Fee
 * Medium
 * <p>
 * Your are given an array of integers prices, for which the i-th element is the price of a given stock on day i; and a
 * non-negative integer fee representing a transaction fee.
 * <p>
 * You may complete as many transactions as you like, but you need to pay the transaction fee for each transaction. You
 * may not buy more than 1 share of a stock at a time (ie. you must sell the stock share before you buy again.)
 * <p>
 * Return the maximum profit you can make.
 * <p>
 * Example 1:
 * Input: prices = [1, 3, 2, 8, 4, 9], fee = 2
 * Output: 8
 * Explanation: The maximum profit can be achieved by:
 * Buying at prices[0] = 1
 * Selling at prices[3] = 8
 * Buying at prices[4] = 4
 * Selling at prices[5] = 9
 * The total profit is ((8 - 1) - 2) + ((9 - 4) - 2) = 8.
 * Note:
 * <p>
 * 0 < prices.length <= 50000.
 * 0 < prices[i] < 50000.
 * 0 <= fee < 50000.
