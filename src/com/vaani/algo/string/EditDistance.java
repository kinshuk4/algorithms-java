/*
Given two words word1 and word2, find the minimum number of steps required to convert word1 to word2. (each operation is counted as 1 step.)

You have the following 3 operations permitted on a word:

a) Insert a character
b) Delete a character
c) Replace a character
*/

/*
At the first glance, we might think this is a DFS problem, but if we see it is hard to find a quick DFS thought and the problem requires some optimal result (here is the minimum), DP is a good direction to consider.
Actually this is a classic DP problem:
The state is:   table[i][j]=minimum number steps convert word1[1:i] to word2[1:j] (here assume string starts from 1).

The optimal function is:  table[i+1][j+1] = min [table[i-1][j-1]+1 or 0 (+1 if word1[i+1]==word2[j+1], else +0),   table[i][j+1]+1, table[i+1][j]+1 ].

Initialization:
table[0][i] = i  i=1:|word1|          here 0 means "", any string convert to "" needs the length of string
table[j][0] = j  i=1:|word2|
table[0][0]=0    "" convert to  "" need 0 steps.
