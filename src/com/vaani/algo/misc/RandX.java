 * Given a function which generates a random integer in the range 1 to 7,

 * The main idea is when you generate a number in the desired range,
 * output that number immediately. If the number is out of the desired range,
 * reject it and re-sample again. As each number in the desired range has
 * the same probability of being chosen, a uniform distribution is produced.
