/**
 * Problem: Given a string which contains only 1 and 0,
 * find out its longest sub-string that contains equal number of �1� and �0�.
 * It should be done in O(n) time, O(n) space.
 * <p/>
 * Example: �111100? => 1100, �00110? => 0110, �001111111000? => 111000.
 * <p/>
 * We can use an array index to store the difference
 * between the number of 1s and the number of 0s up to each character in string S.
 * That is,we create an array diff with size equals to S.length + 1.
 * diff[i] is the number of �1�s appeared up to the ith character in S
 * subtracts the number of �0�s appeared up to ith character in S.
 * <p/>
 * To be more specific, we have this counter initially set to 0,
 * if we meet a �1�, then counter increases by 1.
 * Otherwise the counter decreases by 1.
 * How long is the longest �1 and 0� balanced substring?
 * That is the longest distance between two identical counter in diff.
 * Because the counters are the same, they should meet same number of �1�s and �0�s in between.
