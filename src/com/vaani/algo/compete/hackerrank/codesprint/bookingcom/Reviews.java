 * Guest reviews are an important part of helping travelers choose 
 * destinations that satisfy their passions. Each guest review consists 
 * of a reviewer ID (r), Unix time timestamp denoting the date of the 
 * review (t), and a string of body text (b). 
 * To help determine which reviewers are experts on a specific passion, 
 * we want to score each reviewer for their reviews mentioning that 
 * passion. 
 * A reviewer's score for a single, specific passion is calculated as 
 * follows:
 * 
 * Review Date:
 *  - Reviews having a timestamp, t, in the inclusive range between 
 * June 15th, 2016 and July 15th, 2016 (GMT) are awarded 20 points.
 *  - Reviews written outside of the aforementioned time range (i.e., 
 * before or after) are awarded 10 points.
 * 
 * Review Length:
 *  - A review body, b, having 100 or more characters is awarded 20
 * points.
 *  - A review having less than 100 characters is awarded 10 points.
 * 
 * If a reviewer has more than one review mentioning a specific passion, 
 * their expertise score for that passion is the sum of the scores for 
 * all their reviews mentioning that specific passion.
 * 
 * Determining the foremost expert reviewer with regard to a specific 
 * passion:
 * 
 *  - Score Each Reviewer. Note that a reviewer ID may have multiple 
 * reviews associated with it and a reviewer's expertise score for a 
 * passion is the sum of the scores for all their reviews mentioning 
 * that passion.
 *  - Breaking Ties. If two reviewer IDs have the same expertise score 
 * for a passion, choose the reviewer with the smaller ID.
 * 
 * Given a set of reviews and a list of passions, go through each passion 
 * (in order) and print the reviewer ID (r) for the reviewer having the 
 * highest expertise score for that passion on a new line. If no 
 * reviewers mentioned a specific passion, print -1 instead.
 * 
 * Input Format
 * 
 * The first line contains two positive space-separated integers denoting 
 * the respective values of n (the number of passions) and m (the number 
 * of reviews).
 * Each line i of the n subsequent lines contains a single word describing 
 * passion i.
 * The 2m subsequent lines describe each of the m reviews over two lines:
 * 
 * - The first line contains two space-separated integers describing the 
 * respective 
 * values of r (the reviewer ID) and t (the review's Unix time timestamp 
 * in seconds).
 * - The second line contains a string of text denoting the value of b 
 * (the review's body).
 * 
 * Output Format
 * 
 * Print n lines of output. Each line i must contain a single integer denoting 
 * the reviewer ID (r) of the expert for the ith passion received as input; 
 * if no reviewers mentioned that specific passion, print -1 instead.
 *

Skating is good in Austria

I loved the Spanish food, it had so many varieties and it was super super delicious. The price was a little bit high but it was worth it. People who don't like spicy food might need to think twice as it could be a little bit problematic for them.

I didnâ€™t like the Indian food!
